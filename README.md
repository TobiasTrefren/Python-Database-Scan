<h1>Python Database Scan</h1>

This is a basic program I have written to take a Excel Sheet, run through each column/row and scan it through a site from my state to see if anyone has been charged of anything. This was a project for a family member I did, and instead of manually looking things up, you just format the names in the correct format which takes a few seconds in excel, then it will automatically do what you ask.
